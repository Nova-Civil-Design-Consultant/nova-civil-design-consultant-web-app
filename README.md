# Action Banner Email Trigger Component

## Overview

This project provides a React component called `ActionBanner` that displays a banner with a dynamic question and a "Get In Touch" button. When users click the button, it opens their default email client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) with a pre-filled recipient email address.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/action-banner-email-trigger.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd action-banner-email-trigger
   ```

3. Install all dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Setup

The project relies on a JSON constants file to dynamically inject content into the component. Ensure that you have a `constants/index.json` file, which contains the content for the banner.

Example `constants/index.json` file:

```json
{
  "document": {
    "Action_Banner_Component": {
      "banner_question": "Ready to collaborate with us?",
      "get_in_touch_button": "Get in Touch"
    }
  }
}
```

This file controls the question displayed on the banner and the text for the "Get In Touch" button.

## Usage

To use the `ActionBanner` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the `ActionBanner` component in your application:

   ```jsx
   import ActionBanner from "./components/ActionBanner";
   ```

2. Add the component to your layout where you want the banner to appear:

   ```jsx
   const App = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <ActionBanner />
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

### Constants Configuration

- **Question**: The banner question is fetched from the `constants/index.json` file.
- **Button Text**: The button text is also dynamic and fetched from the constants.

### ActionBanner Component

The `ActionBanner` component renders a banner with an image, a dynamic question, and a "Get In Touch" button.

### Email Trigger Functionality

When the "Get In Touch" button is clicked, the default email client opens with the recipient email address pre-filled.

This is handled using the `mailto:` protocol. You can configure the email address as shown below:

1. Update the `email` variable in the `ActionBanner` component with the desired recipient email address:

   ```javascript
   const email = "your-email@example.com"; // Replace with your email address
   ```

2. The button's `onClick` event is set to trigger the email client:

   ```javascript
   const handleEmailClick = () => {
     window.location.href = `mailto:${email}`;
   };
   ```

   This will open the user's default email client when clicked, with the recipient email address pre-filled.

## Running the Application

To start the application, use one of the following commands:

- With npm:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- With Yarn:

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

This will start the development server, and the application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization

### Change Email Address

You can change the email address that the "Get In Touch" button opens by modifying the `email` variable in the `ActionBanner` component.

```javascript
const email = "new-email@example.com";
```

### Add Subject or Body to Email

If you want to include a subject or body in the email, you can update the `window.location.href` with the following format:

```javascript
window.location.href = `mailto:${email}?subject=Collaboration%20Request&body=Hello,%20I'm%20interested%20in%20collaborating%20with%20you.`;
```

This will open the email client with a pre-filled subject and body.
